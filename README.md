# The Hope's store inventory system

The code contained in this repository is designed to handle the needs of a store.
It is a CRUD system that allows you to manage the products in the "The Hope" store. It is programmed entirely in Python, uses collections such as dictionaries and lists to store information, and has all the functions of a CRUD.
You can create items, delete items, edit items, and calculate the total value of the entire inventory.
It is designed with an elegant and user-friendly interface that is self-explanatory and entertaining.
